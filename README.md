### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge faced in this analysis was understanding how the goals were set and determining the appropirate lenght of time neccessary to be able to achieve the goal set for each camoaign.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 1. That Launch Dates in the fall were less likely to be succesfull.
 2. May and June would be the best times to Launch a new campaign
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 1. That anything Under 10,000 as a goal would likely be sucessfull
 2. anything between 20,000 and 30,000 would have a greater chance of failing
 3. Also you could see a higher level of success with goals set between 35,000 and 45,000.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 1. That the data is limited to a certain set of sub categories
 2. There is no indiction of specific location for the data which could impact things like weather, avg income, etc...
 3. Criteria to determine the outcome was unavalable
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Outcomes based on Country, and average length of time for a successful outcome.
